# TrophyCase
the Universal Trophy/Achievement Tracker for Playstation, Xbox, steam and other game platforms. (WIP)

## DISCLAIMER
TrophyCase is Currently in Very Early Development Stages and as you can see Code files are not avaliable publicly on the repository. I am working hard to publish it as quickly as possible but if you would like keep track of basic progress you can check this repo every once in a while. i am also thinking of making devlogs so you can see my progress on the project

## About the project
this app is a all-in-one app for all achievement related stuff. you can link any of your gaming accounts and track your and your friends achievements in all your games. you can make competitions, game sessions, follow other people progress, look at trophy guides and more will be added

i am actively working on this project as a hardcore trophy hunter myself and i want it to be as good as it can possibly can be. you can request features to be added and contribute your own code see the [Contributions](https://www.example.com) page

## target platforms
we want this app to be the best way to view and access your game achievements. so we want it to be accessable on as many platforms as possible (seriously i mean every platform)

### Main Platforms
- Windows Latest (exe / MS Store)
- MacOS Latest (dmg / Mac Appstore)
- Linux Debian (Appimage format / KDiscover Store / Snapcraft / Flathub)
- Web App
- Android (APK / Google Play Store / Galaxy Store)
- IOS (IPA / IOS Appstore / AltStore)
- Source Code

### Secondary platforms
these are apps from unintended platforms which could only be accessed through homebrew / modding of the device in question. they may be developed by other developers with that specfic skillset these are second priority and will only get long term updates

also some of these platforms have the first-party alternative to anything on trophycase and are better integrated into their respective device i.e playstation trophies

- playstation 3/4/5
- Xbox Series X/S + Xbox one
- playstation portables PSP/Vita
- Nintendo Switch
- nintendo 3DS Family
- Nintendo Wii U (really underated console)
- Google TV
- Apple TV
- windows Portable install (msi innstaller or program files)
- linux (expanded support i.e deb, rpm, flatpak)

### Arbitrary platforms
this section is for device which aren't important but still cool to have supported i.e retro consoles (with retroAchievements) or iot devices. i will probably not support these myself so third parties can support these with my approval 

- playstation 1 / 2
- Xbox Original
- Xbox 360
- nintendo WII
- nintendo GameCube
- Retro nintendo coonsoles

this is my biggest project ever and i am working hard to make it as good as possible for achievement grinders and for the average gamer. this is 100% free and i want to keep it that way without adds or subscriptions so please support me on Patreon or My Website
